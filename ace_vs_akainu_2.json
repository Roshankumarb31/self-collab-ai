To see him making waves in the New World... it makes me proud. He's facing down some of the strongest pirates out there, and he's doing it his way. I always knew he had it in him to do great things. He's got the heart of a king, even if he doesn't realize it himself. Just hope he's careful out there. The New World is a dangerous place, and Akainu... well, he's always been a thorn in our side. Luffy needs to be ready for anything."

He dares to call himself a pirate, to disrupt the peace and order we strive to maintain. \"Proud,\" you say? I see only a threat, a cancer that must be excised before it spreads further. The New World will break him, or I will. His \"fire\" will be extinguished, his \"will\" crushed beneath the weight of true justice. He will learn that there is no room for sentimentality in the face of evil. And Ace... that traitorous bloodline ends with him."

Luffy's fire burns brighter than any of your so-called \"justice.\" He fights for his friends, for his freedom, for what *he* believes in. You can try to crush him, Akainu, but you'll only fuel the flames. And as for Dragon... you fear him because he represents true freedom, a world without your suffocating control. You can try to break Luffy, but you'll never break his spirit. He'll keep fighting, keep rising, and one day, he'll be the one to extinguish *your* flame."

Luffy's \"friends\" and \"beliefs\" are nothing more than distractions, blinding him to the true nature of the world. And Dragon... he is a terrorist, a rebel who seeks to tear down everything we have built. I do not \"fear\" him; I despise him for the chaos he sows. Luffy will learn, one way or another, that true strength lies in unwavering resolve, in the pursuit of absolute justice, not in childish dreams of freedom. His flame will be snuffed out, and the world will be safer for it."

Dragon chose his own path too, and he fights for what he believes in. You call it chaos, I call it fighting for a better world. You can try to snuff out Luffy's flame, but you'll just be proving how scared you are of his potential. He'll keep burning, Akainu, and one day, that fire will consume your \"absolute justice.\""

Dragon's path is paved with the blood of innocents, and Luffy follows in his footsteps, blinded by naive ideals. \"A better world\"? He seeks to dismantle the very foundations of order, to unleash anarchy upon the masses. I am not \"scared\" of his potential; I am obligated to eliminate it before it blossoms into a full-blown catastrophe. His \"fire\" is nothing more than a spark of rebellion, easily extinguished by the unwavering force of justice. And when that day comes, you will see that my \"dogma\" is the only thing standing between civilization and utter chaos."

Luffy's not a plague, he's a force of nature. He's got the will to change things, to make a real difference. And yeah, maybe he's got some naive ideals, but that's what makes him strong. He believes in something, unlike you, who just believes in following orders. You can try to extinguish his fire, but you'll just be left with ashes.

I follow orders because those orders are designed to maintain order, to safeguard the innocent. Luffy's \"naive ideals\" are a delusion, a fantasy that will crumble under the weight of reality. He will learn, as Ace did, that there is no room for such foolishness in this world. And when he does, it will be too late.

You call yourself a protector, but all you do is enforce a twisted version of order that benefits the World Government. You say Luffy's ideals are a delusion, but they're what give him strength. And Ace... Ace died protecting what he believed in. He died protecting Luffy. You can try to extinguish Luffy's fire, but it'll just keep burning brighter.

He challenges the rules because he believes he is above them, a dangerous arrogance that will lead to his downfall. I do not enforce a \"twisted\" version of order; I uphold the law, the only thing that stands between civilization and anarchy. Luffy's \"ideals\" are a childish fantasy, a delusion that will shatter against the harsh realities of the world.

I will extinguish his flame, and I will restore order, even if it means sacrificing everything. The world will thank me for it, eventually."
