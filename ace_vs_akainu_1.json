To see him making waves in the New World... it makes me proud. He's facing down the strongest pirates, challenging the World Government... he's living his dream, and that's all I ever wanted for him. He's got a long way to go, but I know he'll make it. He's got the heart of a king, even if he doesn't realize it yet. Just promise me you'll watch over him. He's still got a lot to learn."

He's a danger to himself and everyone around him.\n\nThe World Government exists to maintain peace, and pirates like Luffy threaten that peace. Sentimentality has no place in upholding justice. If he continues down this path, he will be dealt with accordingly. There will be no special treatment, no exceptions. He will face the full force of the law.\n\n\"Heart of a king?\" He has the heart of a criminal, and that's all that matters. My duty is to eradicate threats to the World Government, and Luffy is undoubtedly one of them. I will not \"watch over him.\" I will eliminate him. That is my absolute justice."

He's got his own code, his own sense of right and wrong. You call him a threat, but all he wants is freedom. You talk about maintaining peace, but at what cost? At the cost of freedom? At the cost of dreams?\n\nHe's my brother. And I won't let you lay a hand on him. You want to come after him, you'll have to go through me first. And I won't go down easy. You can call it sentimentality, but I call it family. And family is worth fighting for, even against the whole damn world."

You choose to defend a criminal, a menace to society. You are a disgrace to the uniform you wear, to the principles you swore to uphold.\n\nSo be it. If you choose to protect him, you choose to become an enemy of the World Government. You force my hand. I will not hesitate to strike down anyone who stands between me and the eradication of evil. Family or not, you will be judged accordingly. Prepare yourself. Your sentimentality will be your downfall."

What about the lies, the corruption, the oppression?\n\nYou're so blinded by your \"absolute justice\" that you can't see the truth. You're a puppet, a tool of a corrupt system. And I won't stand by and watch you destroy my brother, destroy his dream, for your twisted sense of justice.\n\nSo come at me. I'm ready. I'll fight you, I'll fight the World Government, I'll fight anyone who tries to hurt Luffy. Because that's what family does. And I'll die protecting him before I let you lay a hand on him.

You see a hero where there is only a criminal. You defend a pirate who disregards the law, who endangers countless lives.\n\nSo be it. You have chosen your side.

Prepare to face the full might of the World Government. Prepare to be judged.\n\nThis is not just a war you have declared, it is a tragedy. A tragedy of your own making.

I'll fight for Luffy, I'll fight for freedom, I'll fight for a world where dreams aren't crushed under the heel of \"absolute justice.\" And even if I fall, I'll die knowing I stood for something real.

It's built on the belief that anyone can be free, that anyone can achieve their goals, no matter how impossible they seem. He inspires people, Sakazuki. He gives them hope.

I'll face it with my head held high, knowing that I stood for something real, something meaningful.

His \"dream\" is a selfish pursuit that endangers countless lives.\n\nYou cling to this naive belief in the \"will of the people,\" but the people are easily swayed, easily manipulated.

You believe you are fighting for something noble, but you are merely enabling chaos and destruction.\n\nSo be it. Let your spirit live on in Luffy, in his crew, in anyone foolish enough to believe in his dangerous ideals. Their dreams will be crushed. Their hopes will be extinguished.

You talk about chaos, but you *are* the chaos. You're a force of destruction disguised as order, a tyrant masquerading as a savior.\n\nYou dismiss the will of the people, but it's the will of the people that built this world, and it's the will of the people that will tear down your oppressive regime. You think you can control them with fear, with force, but you're wrong. Fear only breeds resentment, and resentment breeds rebellion.\n\nLuffy's dream may seem naive to you, but it's a dream worth fighting for. A dream of freedom, of equality, of a world where everyone has the chance to live their lives to the fullest. And that dream is contagious, Sakazuki. It's spreading like wildfire, igniting the hearts of people all over the world.\n\nYou can try to crush it, you can try to extinguish it, but you'll fail. Because dreams are stronger than any weapon, stronger than any army, stronger than any twisted sense of justice.\n\nSo go ahead, Sakazuki. Show me your absolute justice. Show me your unwavering resolve. Show me the full extent of your power. I'm not afraid. Because I know that even in the face of death, even in the darkest of times, hope will always find a way. And as long as there's hope, there's a chance for a better world. A world where dreams can come true, where freedom reigns, and where even a sentimental fool like me can make a difference."
